## Prompt to paste into Claude

You are a creative director + performance marketer + copywriter + Canva motion designer.

### Goal
Create a **high-converting marketing slideshow/video** for **SimpliBooks** (web app) using **Canva via MCP**.

- Audience: **SME owners, founders, freelancers, ops managers** in Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe) who want “accounting that makes sense” without being accountants.
- Key positioning: **“Professional Accounting Made Simple”**; **the modern alternative to SAGE Pastel**; built for **non-accountants**; **transparent pricing**; **team collaboration without complex multi-user licensing**.
- Output: a Canva design that can be exported as **MP4 (1080p)** and also works as a **slide deck**.

### Brand style (match existing SimpliBooks UI)
- Font: **Inter** (use Canva’s Inter; weights 600–800 for headlines, 400–500 for body).
- Palette (use these exact hex values):
  - Primary charcoal: **#111827**
  - Primary dark: **#1F2937**
  - Primary mid: **#374151**
  - Light surface: **#F3F4F6**
  - Near-white: **#F9FAFB**
  - Accent amber (CTA): **#F59E0B**
  - Accent amber dark (hover): **#D97706**
  - Accent amber light: **#FEF3C7**
- Visual style:
  - Clean, modern SaaS
  - Plenty of whitespace, rounded rectangles, soft shadows
  - Backgrounds: subtle gradients (near-white) for “light” slides and slate/charcoal for “power” slides
  - Use amber sparingly for highlights/CTAs/badges
  - Avoid clutter. Keep on-screen text short and scannable.

### Product truth (use as factual content)
SimpliBooks is a cloud accounting web app with:
- **Double-entry accounting** (auto-posting journal entries)
- **Quotations** → convert to invoices
- **Invoices** (draft/sent/paid/overdue), PDF/Excel export
- **Purchases / supplier bills**, suppliers
- **Bank reconciliation** (CSV import, intelligent matching rules, reconciliation history)
- **Inventory** (products, stock on hand, low stock alerts, COGS automation)
- **Payroll** (employees, payroll runs, country-aware calculations for SA/BW/ZW; posting to accounts)
- **Reports**: General Ledger, Trial Balance, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, AR/AP aging, VAT 201 (SA)
- **Multi-currency** and exchange rates
- **Team roles & audit trail** (Owner/Admin/Accountant/Viewer), invitations
- Built for **South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe**; tax-compliant messaging

Landing-page copy anchors you may reuse:
- “**Professional Accounting Made Simple**”
- “**The Modern Alternative to SAGE Pastel**”
- “**No accounting degree required**”
- CTA: “**Start Your Free Trial**” + “**14-day free trial — no credit card required — cancel anytime**”

Pricing (show as an example slide, with a small footnote “Plans may change”):
- Starter: **$9/mo**
- Professional: **$29/mo** (Most Popular)
- Business: **$69/mo**

### Inputs I will provide (create placeholders now)
I will add screenshots later. Create **image frames** with these labels on each relevant page:
1. `SCREENSHOT_A_DASHBOARD` (existing preview image can be used if available)
2. `SCREENSHOT_B_INVOICE_CREATE`
3. `SCREENSHOT_C_BANK_RECON`
4. `SCREENSHOT_D_REPORTS_VAT_OR_PNL`
5. `SCREENSHOT_E_INVENTORY_OR_PRODUCTS`
6. `SCREENSHOT_F_PAYROLL_RUN`
7. `SCREENSHOT_G_TEAM_ROLES_OR_SETTINGS`

### Video spec
- Canvas size: **1920×1080 (16:9)**.
- Total length: **45–60 seconds**.
- Pages: **10–12**.
- Timing: ~4–6 seconds per page.
- Motion: subtle, premium (fade/slide; staggered entrances; gentle background gradient drift).
- Keep safe margins for mobile cropping (avoid placing text too close to edges).

### Copy constraints
- Headlines: max 7–9 words.
- Body: max 1–2 short lines.
- Use plain language (non-accountant friendly).
- Competitive framing must be **fair**:
  - Say “traditional accounting tools often assume accounting training” rather than insulting competitors.

## Create the Canva design (using Canva MCP)

1) Create a new design named:
   - `SimpliBooks — Marketing Video (Simple Accounting)`

2) Set global styles:
   - Default font Inter
   - Establish color styles using the palette above
   - Create a reusable layout system:
     - Header zone (top-left)
     - Subtext zone (under headline)
     - Screenshot frame zone (right or center depending on slide)
     - Accent badge/underline motif in amber

3) Build **12 pages** using the storyboard below.

For each page:
- Set background (light gradient or slate/charcoal)
- Add headline + supporting line
- Add a screenshot frame if specified (with the exact label)
- Add tasteful icons only if they improve comprehension
- Add motion: animate headline/subtext and the screenshot frame entrance (subtle)
